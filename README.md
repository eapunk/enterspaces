# enterspaces

Pretty debug trace: [web app](https://eapunk.github.io/enterspaces/).

The project is based on [purescript-enterspaces](https://github.com/eapunk/purescript-enterspaces) library
and [ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) editor.

I use it to deep into the output of haskell Debug.trace function with generic Show instances.

It can beautify JSON too.

See some [tests](https://github.com/eapunk/purescript-enterspaces/blob/master/test/Text/Show/Pretty.purs) for examples.

Compiled js is placed on branch `gh-pages`.
